- **Authentication** (`06-concepts/11-authentication/`) - Implementing authentication with various providers
- **Testing** (`06-concepts/19-testing/`) - Serverpod-specific testing patterns and best practices
- **Deployments** (`07-deployments/`) - Production deployment strategies for various cloud platforms
- **Tools** (`09-tools/`) - Development tools including Insights and LSP

### `/project-analysis/` - Project Analysis and Reports
Analysis documents and inventories that help understand the current state of the project.

- **SERVERPOD_DEMO_FILES_INVENTORY.md** - Inventory of demo files from Serverpod that may need cleanup

## üìã Usage Guidelines

### For New Developers
1. Begin with the core documents in `/core-documents/` to understand the project vision and architecture
2. Read all documents in `/development-guides/` to understand our development approach
3. Pay special attention to `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` and `TEST_WRITING_GUIDE.md`
4. For Serverpod basics, start with `/serverpod-docs/01-get-started/` to understand endpoints, models, and database operations
5. Reference these guides frequently during development

### When Implementing Features
1. Check if there's an existing implementation plan in `/feature-plans/`
2. Use the plan as a reference but adapt to current project state
3. For Serverpod-specific features, consult `/serverpod-docs/` for detailed implementation patterns
4. Update or create new plans for complex features

### Contributing Documentation
- **Development Guides**: Only add/modify after team discussion. These are permanent references.
- **Feature Plans**: Create for complex features requiring step-by-step guidance. Can be archived after feature completion.
- **Project Analysis**: Add reports that help understand or improve the codebase.

## üîó Integration with CLAUDE.md

The root `CLAUDE.md` file references several documents here, particularly:
- `/docs/development-guides/TEST_WRITING_GUIDE.md` - Referenced for TDD practices
- Other guides may be referenced as needed

Always ensure CLAUDE.md stays synchronized with documentation structure changes.
