# Zenvestor Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable systematic, emotion-free execution of CAN SLIM trading methodology through automated multi-stage position entries and rule-based exits
- Reduce daily portfolio management time from 2 hours to 15 minutes while handling increased complexity
- Support sophisticated pyramiding strategies (3-10 lots) that are impractical with manual execution
- Provide real-time portfolio analytics for risk management across multiple portfolios
- Create comprehensive audit trail through integrated journaling linked to trading decisions
- Achieve 95%+ adherence to predetermined trading rules through automation
- Build foundation for future community features and systematic trading knowledge sharing

### Background Context

Zenvestor addresses the fundamental conflict between optimal trading strategy and practical execution limitations. While sophisticated multi-stage entry and exit strategies significantly improve risk-adjusted returns, manual execution forces traders to use simplified approaches that leave money on the table. During critical market rallies when opportunities are greatest, operational complexity overwhelms even experienced traders, leading to missed entries, poor position sizing, and emotional decision-making.

This platform transforms the trading experience by automating the mechanical aspects of trade execution while preserving the trader's strategic decision-making authority. By integrating directly with Alpaca's trading API and implementing a disciplined pyramiding entry system, Zenvestor enables individual traders to execute institutional-quality strategies while maintaining the focused, concentrated portfolio approach that CAN SLIM methodology demands.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please begin UI/UX specification creation for Zenvestor using the front-end-spec template. Focus on mobile-first design for Android as the primary platform, with responsive web as secondary. The interface should embody "systematic calm" with efficient workflows for active traders. Pay special attention to the journaling integration touchpoints throughout the user journey.

### Architect Prompt

Please begin architecture document creation for Zenvestor using the architecture template. The system uses Dart/Serverpod backend with Flutter frontend, following clean architecture principles with 100% test coverage requirement. Focus on the client-server separation with Serverpod's code generation, Bloc pattern integration, and comprehensive CI/CD setup outlined in Epic 1. Address the monorepo structure and how the shared generated client code enables type-safe communication.
